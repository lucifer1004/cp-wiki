# About Codeforces Contests

There are 4 divisions (Div.1--Div.4), and the lower bound for Div.1--Div.3 is 1900/2100, 1600, 1300.

The 1900 bound (candidate master) for Div.1 applies to regular rounds where there are separate Div.1 and Div.2 contests, while the 2100 bound (master) applies to Div.2 only rounds.
